# OneButton
OneButton is a link resolving application designed to streamline resource sharing for consortia.  OneButton can be used to replace multiple resource sharing options with a single request button, which checks available group circulation holdings and availability and routes the user to the appropriate request form.

OneButton was designed for the WorldCat Local/Discovery environment and relies on the OCLC Availability API, but could be adapted using any library service platform with a holdings/availability API that displays group holdings.
